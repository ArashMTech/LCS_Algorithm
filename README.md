# LCS Algorithm
This is a sample project for implementation LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm with c++ language programming

Description:

1. Type first string like this => bcab
2. Type second string like this => abc
3. After you press enter, lcs algorithm calculated.

Result:

lenght of string for answer is: 2
result is :
  bc
  ab
  
Notice: This sample at time O(n*m) find the largest common sub-sequence for the two strings.
